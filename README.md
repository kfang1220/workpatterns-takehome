### About this Project

This project was a take home for Workpatterns. The task was to create a view to see a user's Email Reply Time with other organizations and how it changes over time. I tried to limit myself to a few hours as the mentioned time frame for a MVP. I managed to get basic functionality and covered overall requirements but will work on unspecified features. 
I decided to define Email Response Time in minutes as that's the most realistic representation on a high level. The table was made with material ui but could've been done with native html as well. 

Things to consider/potential ideas:
1. User input for any email for any given JSON file. This makes the task somewhat of an application as it current only displays data with a given hard coded email.
2. Years to be included rather than just 12 months. A single year could be displayed at any given time and I would paginate the rest. (Work in Progress)
3. A dropdown or button to change from minutes to other units of time.
